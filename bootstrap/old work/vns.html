  <h5 style="margin-left: 6%; margin-top: 2%;margin-right: 10%;"><i>
      <p>Varanasi, also known as Benaras,Banaras or Kashi, is
        a city situated on the banks of Ganga river in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh dating to the 11th
        century B.C. Regarded as the spiritual capital of India. A major religious hub in India, it is the holiest of
        the seven sacred cities in Hinduism and Jainism. The city draws Hindu pilgrims who bathe in the Ganges River's
        sacred waters and perform funeral rites. Along the city's winding streets are some 2,000 temples, including Kashi
        Vishwanath, the "Golden Temple", dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.</p>

      <p>Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its muslim and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works,
        and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon,
        "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious importance continued to grow
        in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. During the
        Muslim rule through Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage,
        mysticism and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and
        religious education. Tulsidas wrote his epic poem on Rama's life called Ram Charit Manas in Varanasi.</p>

      <p>In the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the
        city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though much of modern Varanasi was built during
        the 18th century, by the Maratha and Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the
        Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. Silk weaving,
        carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the Diesel Locomotive Works
        and Bharat Heavy Electricals.</p>

      <p>Varanasi has been a cultural centre of North India for several thousand years, and is closely associated with
        the Ganges. Hindus believe that death in the city will bring salvation, making it a major centre for pilgrimage. The
        city is known worldwide for its many ghats, embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where
        pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the
        Manikarnika Ghat and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the Hindu
        genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">1. Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi</h3>
  <center><img src="pics/vns0.jpg"></center>
  <h5 style="margin-top: 2%;margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 10%;">
    <p>Many people see it as the foremost temple to visit in Varanasi, and some
      consider it the most significant temple in the entire country. <a
        href="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/kashi-vishwanath-temple-varanasi/">The story of Kashi Vishwanath
        Temple</a> is as old as
      over three thousand and five hundred years, which is an astounding amount of time. So much has happened in and
      around it that it is hard to not feel overwhelmed when visiting it. It is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas that are
      Shivalingas that are the physical symbols of Lord Shiva. The spires and domes of the shrine are completely
      covered
      in gold. The then ruler of Punjab, Maharaja Ranjit Singh was responsible for that, as covering temple domes in
      gold
      is a Punjabi tradition, as demonstrated in the Golden Temple. Many devotees believe that a single glimpse of the
      Shivalinga cleanses your soul and puts life on a path of knowledge.</p>

    <br>Timings: 2:30 AM to 11:00 PM
    <br>Temple Schedule:
    <br>a. Mangal Aarti: 2:30 AM
    <br>b. Bhog Aarti: 11:30 AM to 12:00 pm

    <br>d. Shringar/Bhog Aarti: 9:00 PM (only outside darshan allowed)
    <br>e. Shayana Aarti: 10:30 PM</br>
  </h5>
  <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">2.Durga Temple, Varanasi</h3>
  <center><img src="pics/vns1.jpg"></center>
  <h5 style="margin-top: 2%;margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 10%;">
    <p>Dedicated to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/bootstrap/durga%20temple.html">Goddness Durga</a>, this temple is a symbol of feminine divinity. The deity present in this temple is
      believed to have materialised out of thin air and was not made by any man. Another badge of feminism for this
      temple is that it was actually commissioned by a woman. The Maharani of Bengal was responsible for its making
      and it was according to her wishes that it was constructed in the Nagara style of architecture. But, the most
      interesting fact about this temple is perhaps the fact that it is visited by several monkeys every day. In fact,
      there are so many monkeys here that it is often called ‘Monkey Temple’. So, beware of those mischievous apes
      when visiting here!</p>

    <br>Timings: 5:00 AM- 9:00 PM</br>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">3. Bharat Mata Temple, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns2,jpg.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 2%;margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>Being dedicated to the country itself, it is one of the rarest temples in the country. India is famous for its
        millions of temples and nationalist spirit, but there are very few places that commemorate the country itself.
        And since this is such a rare temple, it is visited by almost everyone who comes to Varanasi. Situated within
        the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith campus, it was inaugurated by Gandhi himself in 1936. It was supposed to be
        an inspiring beacon of love and hope for all that were fighting against the British. Instead of a statue of a
        deity that looks like a human, this temple’s statue is that of mountains, plains and oceans.</p>

      <br>Timings: 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">4. Alamgir Mosque, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns3.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 2%;margin-left: 6%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>On a list filled with temples, Alamgir mosque stands proudly as a
        representation of Muslims who have lived here for centuries. Famed for its incredible Islamic architecture, this
        mosque is unique in the fact that it is located at the banks of the Ganga. It is believed that the Mughal Sultan
        Aurangzeb who was the great-grandchild of Akbar, constructed it. Another name for emperor Aurangzeb was Alamgir,
        which is why this mosque is called as such. Historically, it has been noted that Aurangzeb was responsible for
        the
        demolishment of a temple to construct the mosque. But still, the mosque retained many Hindu influences as can be
        seen in its unique architecture and art.</p>

      <br>Timings: 7:00 AM- 7:00 PM</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">5. Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns4.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>This particular ghat is believed to be the oldest one in the city, and is hence considered special. If you have
        seen video footages of people bathing in Ganga and praying with diyas in their hand on the banks of a river,
        odds are that it was this ghat you saw. It is often abuzz because of the hordes of people who flock to it to
        wash away their sins and pray. Ascetics, Hindu devotees and tourists alike all alight on the banks of the Ganga
        at Dashashwamedh Ghat on a daily basis. Being such an important landmark and host to the famous Ganga aarti, it
        is a <a href="https://www.fabhotels.com/blog/a-handy-guide-for-a-trip-to-varanasi/"> must-visit on any trip to
          Varanasi</a>!</p>

      <br>Aarti Timings: 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM (summers); 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM (winters)</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">6. Manikarnika Ghat</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns5.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>This ghat is again quite significant among Hindus as it is the main cremation ghat in the city. People who have
        died often get cremated here, in the belief that they attain moksha. There is a myth that says Devi Parvati’s
        ear
        ornament fell at the exact spot of this ghat when Lord Shiva came here with her. Although the atmosphere is
        rather
        grim here most days, it is still a very historical place to visit if you are in Varanasi. Also, referred to as
        the
        burning ghat, it is certainly an important part of Varanasi, just as death is to life!</p>

      <br>Timings: Open throughout the day</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">7. Assi Ghat, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns6.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>Assi Ghat is believed to be the place where the legendary poet Tulsidas passed away. The southernmost ghat in
        the
        region, it is among the most popular with tourists. On an average day about 300 people visit it per hour, but
        during festival days that number can be as high as 2500 people. When here, you can go on a leisurely boat ride
        on
        the river or even a hot air balloon excursion! Devotees bathe here before conducting rituals as the water of the
        river is said to purity their soul, preparing them for the task.</p>

      <br>Timings: Open throughout the day</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">8. Manmandir Ghat, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns7.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>It was commissioned to by Raja Man Singh in the early 1600s. He had a large stone balcony built on the northern
        corner of the ghat so he could sit there and enjoy the serenity. Compared to other ghats, this ghat has a lower
        footfall which makes it an excellent place to spend a day at. Located just north of Dashashwamedh ghat, it is a
        great spot for observing the Ganga flow peacefully. Another great reason to visit this ghat is its closeness to
        several prominent temples, so you can cover numerous places in one go. Some of the closest temples are Someshwar
        Temple, Rameshwar Temple and Sthuladanta Vinayaka.</p>

      <br>Timings: Open throughout the day.</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">9. Ghyan Wapi Well, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns8.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>The name of this well means the well of wisdom, which is exactly what is believed about the water of this well.
        It is said to possess wisdom in its water and people who drink from it are benefited by it. Whether you are
        superstitious or not, there is some interesting history regarding this legendary well. It is believed that the
        Jyotirlinga that was removed from the old Kashi Vishwanath Temple that Mughal emperor Aurangzeb destroyed is at
        the bottom of this well. It has been there since the 17th century when the old temple was demolished to build
        the mosque adjacent to the well. Apart from the mythical aspect of this place, the architecture and art
        expressed in its construction also make it worth visiting!</p>

      <br>Timings: Open throughout the day.</br>
    </h5>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;">10. Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/vns9.jpg"></center>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 6%;margin-left: 3%;margin-right: 10%;">
      <p>With about 30,000 students inside the campus, the Banaras Hindu University falls in the list of the biggest
        residential institutions in the world. The beautiful buildings and sprawling lawns will make you fall in love
        with this iconic, educational institution.</p>

      <br>Location: Teliyana, Bazardiha, Maheshpur, Varanasi</br>
