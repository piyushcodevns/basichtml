        <p><b><i>THERE ARE COUNTLESS TEMPLES IN VARANASI</i></b> ,the holy city of Hindus. There is a story behind every
            temple, there is
            some belief behind the construction of every temple.</p>
        <p>Kolkata emerged as a major trading city under the British rule, during this time many temples were built in
            Varanasi by the wealthy people of Kolkata. During that time a major temple built and renovated in Varanasi
            was Durgakund Temple.
            Even today this temple is counted among the most prominent temples of Varanasi.</p>

    </center>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 10%;margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 3%;">
        <p>Undoubtedly it is one of the oldest temples of
            Varanasi. The mention of this temple is also found in<b><u> Kashi Khand</u></b>. It is believed that in
            ancient times the holy
            Ganges water used to come into the pond through a special drainage system in Durgakund.</p>

        <p><i>Note:– This seems quite possible because in the famous Vishwanath temple of Varanasi the Shiva Linga was
                located in a small pond and in this pond the holy water of Ganga used to come into the pond through a
                special
                drainage system. This is described by James Prinsep in his book ~ Benares Illustrated.</i></p>

    </center>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 10%;margin-right: 10%; margin-top: 3%;">
        <p>According to a story in Chapter 23 of <b style="color: lightcoral;">Devi Bhagavata Purana</b>, once upon a
            time in Varanasi there was a king named
            <b style="color: lightcoral;">Subahu</b>. King Subahu had a daughter. Her name was <b
                style="color: lightcoral;">Shashikala</b>.
        <p>

        <p>When Shashikala became mature enough, his father King Subahu of Kashi eventually decided to organize a
            swayamvara for her marriage. Svayamvara was a system of marriage of princesses in ancient India. In which
            princesses themselves chose a man as her husband from a group of suitors. The men in the group were
            generally
            Princes and Kings. The meaning is self-evident from the word itself, svayam in Sanskrit means ‘self’ and
            vara
            means ‘groom’.</p>

        <p>Kashi Naresh King Subahu later came to know that his daughter was in love with a forest resident prince
            Sudarshan, so instead of organizing a swayamvara, the king married her to Sudarshan as per the daughter’s
            wish.</p>

        <p>When getting to know about the marriage, all the kings invited to the swayamvara got angry. They formed a
            united
            army and attacked the king of Kashi. When the King of Kashi(King Subahu) and Sudarshan prayed to Goddess
            Durga,
            she fought on behalf of the King of Kashi in the war. Goddess Durga defeated all the kings by her might.
            Thereafter, to express his gratitude to Goddess Durga, King Subahu got this temple constructed at this
            place.</p>

        <p><b><i>There is another story regarding this.</i></b></p>

        <p> <i><b>According to the legend</b></i> that after killing <b
                style="color: lightcoral;">Shumbha-Nishumbha</b>, Goddess Durga rested at this place after getting
            tired. Later, a temple was built by the king of Banaras in memory of the incident of Goddess Durga resting
            at
            this place.</p>
